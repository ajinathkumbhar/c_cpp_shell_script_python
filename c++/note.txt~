- Hand run
- We can write code for 2 or many program and execute it for different name and separate with argv[0]( check init.cpp) 
- int main( int argc, char * argv[] ) -- can be -- int main(int argc, char ** argv)
- write signal handler as following 

system/core/init/init.cpp
968      action.sa_handler = [](int signal) {
969          // These signal handlers are also caught for processes forked from init, however we do not
970          // want them to trigger reboot, so we directly call _exit() for children processes here.
971          if (getpid() != 1) {
972              _exit(signal);
973          }
974  
975          // panic() reboots to bootloader
976          panic();
977      };

- static ?
- char const * and const char * ?
- gcc vs g++ vs c++ vs clang
- For Example to redirect the stdout to say a textfile, we could write (freopen)?
- The tuple is not avavilable in c++98, Use -std=c++11  to compile program with #include<tuple>
- Print cpp standerd version ( cout << __cplusplus ;)
- Use array as like map ( ref camera HAL characteritics)
- Use structure and function pointer ( ref user space driver lib)
