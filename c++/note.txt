- Hand run
- We can write code for 2 or many program and execute it for different name and separate with argv[0]( check init.cpp) 
- int main( int argc, char * argv[] ) -- can be -- int main(int argc, char ** argv)
- write signal handler as following 

system/core/init/init.cpp
968      action.sa_handler = [](int signal) {
969          // These signal handlers are also caught for processes forked from init, however we do not
970          // want them to trigger reboot, so we directly call _exit() for children processes here.
971          if (getpid() != 1) {
972              _exit(signal);
973          }
974  
975          // panic() reboots to bootloader
976          panic();
977      };
